    <h5>EDITORIAL DESIGN</h5>
    <h2>Star Tribune</h2>
    <p class="summary">My experience designing news, features, and sports print sections and digital layouts for the Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis, MN.</p>
    <p class="details"><span>Role</span> Print and Digital Design Intern <span>Timeline</span> June - August 2022 (10 weeks) </p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>Driftless Photo Story</h3>
      <p>This story was about a group of "bikepackers" (backpackers, but on bikes) cycling over 200 miles in southeast Minnesota's Driftless Area.</p>
      <p>The aim was to have a design that showcased the trip through the stunning visuals.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>THC Experiment</h3>
      <p>This story involved a reporter trying four different THC products for the first time, and documenting her experience.</p>
      <p>Since the print paper could only have the cover page (left) in color, I designed a black and white version for the jump page (right) that could potentially be used as a coloring page.</p>
      <p>Check out my digital presentation and read the full story <a href="https://www.startribune.com/our-reporter-tested-four-new-thc-products-heres-what-happened-minnesota-gummies-edibles/600197718/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" >here</a>.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>North Dakota vs. South Dakota: Comedic Argumentative Story</h3>
      <p>This story involved two reporters: one from North Dakota, the other from South Dakota. And both felt very passionate about what their state had to offer that the other didn't.</p>
      <p>From the start, my art director and I knew that the illustration would need to reflect the comedic nature of the story, and visually show the clash between the two Dakotas. This illustration and page design was the result.</p>
      <p>Check out my digital presentation and read the full story <a href="https://www.startribune.com/why-minnesotans-are-all-wrong-about-the-dakotas/600193995/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" >here</a>.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>Summer Things to Do in Minneapolis</h3>
      <p>This story is a recurring story that appears in some shape or form every summer in the Star Tribune newspaper. This year, it broke down the best, and most unexpected, things to do with the second-half of the summer. After all, Minnesotans have to enjoy the warm weather while it lasts.</p>
      <p>This was my first cover illustration project during my internship, and I decided to do a vertical format to accommodate all the various activities I would collage together. The jump page (right) ended up having space to add photos from a handful of the activities.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>Inner Page Illustrations</h3>
      <p>These illustrations were for smaller stories located in the middle of sections, and therefore were allocated as black and white pages. However, the black and white canvas lended well to the dour tone of the stories.</p>
