        <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
        <h3>'Hearty meal': Valentine's Day Themed Food Spread </h3>
        <p>This story was a recipe guide from a Daily Orange columnist themed for Valentine's Day. Of course, chocolate-dipped strawberries and flowers were included. But the pasta was an unexpected take on "date night" food to level up the 2022 season of Valentine's Day.</p>
        <p>The beautiful photos were taken by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-hendricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Hendricks</a>.</p>

        <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
        <h3>'Finals fuel': Ramen Food Spread </h3>
        <p>This story was a recipe guide from a Daily Orange columnist aimed at university students looking for an improvement on instant ramen (aka, 'finals fuel', for many).</p>
        <p>When approaching this design, I knew I wanted to emphasize the healthier option to instant ramen. To do this, I arranged the scene with a crisp and clean white background, so that the vegetables' bright colors could shine. The beautiful photos were taken by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-mimaroglu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Mimaroglu</a>.</p>
        <p>This spread was the last big project I designed for the DO before handing off the reins to the next Presentation Director. The food spreads were some of my favorite passion projects that I did during my time at the DO, because of the freedom to be creative and get messy. And of course, the leftovers.</p>
