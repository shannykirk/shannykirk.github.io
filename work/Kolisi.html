    <h5>MARKETING & DESIGN</h5>
    <h2>Kolisi Foundation</h2>
    <p class="summary">My experience designing campaigns, posters, social media, and an annual report for a non-profit organization in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
    <p class="details"><span>Role</span> Graphic Design Intern  <span>Timeline</span> 10 weeks </p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>Annual Report</h3>
      <p>An annual report is an essential document for any non-profit organization that summarizes the past year's programs, milestones, and financial information to current and potential donors.</p>
      <p>Since this was the Kolisi Foundation's very first annual report, a lot of work was done to figure out what to say and how to condense an entire year of impactful work into a managable amount. This was my primary project over the course of my 10 weeks in Cape Town. </p>
      <p>The published version will be available by the end of 2023, coming soon! To hold you off for now, here's a sneak peek:</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>Inspirational Posters</h3>
      <p>This was a quick passion project, towards the end of my internship. The Kolisi team was working on a revamp of the Saartjie Baartman Centre, and these posters added a colorful and inspirational pop to the walls.</p>
      <p>The photo of the posters in real life was photographed by Carli Smith.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>Fundraising Campaigns</h3>
      <p>Fundraising is a crucial part of any non-profit organization to keep the work going. Part of my job for these 10 weeks was to create a variety of campaign materials ranging from branded popcorn boxes to "table talker" information cards.</p>

      <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
      <h3>The end of one chapter</h3>
      <p>Although my time in Cape Town only lasted 10 short weeks, I am continuing to work with the Kolisi Foundation team on a freelance basis back in my home of New York.</p>
