      <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
      <h3>The Backstory</h3>
      <p>In 2018, I was a part of the first Everson Museum Teen Arts Council. This program brought young creatives of all sorts together to create two full exhibitions from start to finish, to be displayed in the museum for three months. I learned the balance and forethought that goes into curating a selection of work and worked alongside fellow creatives.</p>
      <p>In 2020, right before the onset of the pandemic, I connected with the curators at the museum with an idea in mind: to create the exhibition poster for one of these exhibitions. Truly a full circle moment.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/%5B1%5D%20Web%20Images%20-%20Size%201%20(2000%20%C3%97%201300%20px).png">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>PROBLEM OVERVIEW</h5>
      <h3>How might we capture themes of struggle and growth in an exhibition poster?</h3>
      <p>The chosen theme of the spring 2020 exhibition was the struggles of growing up in today’s age. Namely, being told over and over to “grow up” without being given the guidance on how to do so. Therefore, the title of the exhibition became: “Grow up? We’re Trying.”</p>
      <p>Through my exhibition poster, I needed to address the pains of growing up, while still keeping it youthful, playful and vibrant.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>IDEATION</h5>
      <h3>The sketching process</h3>
      <p>I started off with some concepts that focused on the iconic architectural style of the museum building itself (which was designed by I.M. Pei). I also played around with using the typography to show the struggle of growing. However, both of these concepts seemed to be lacking the human element that was central to this exhibition.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/Process%20videos%20(2).gif">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>IDEATION</h5>
      <h3>The plot thickens</h3>
      <p>I moved forward with this idea that I wanted to show a playful, engaging, human struggle. I also couldn’t shake my attraction to playing with the typography and incorporating it into the illustration.</p>
      <p>So I combined the two.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/Process%20videos%20(3).gif">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>DESIGN ELEMENTS</h5>
      <h3>The characters</h3>
      <p>In a previous project, focusing on Sigmund Freud, I had used randomized scribbles to communicate entropy, chaos, and disorganization. Fresh off of this past project, I decided to bring this design element back into the limelight one more time, in the form of typography filling.</p>
      <img src="">
      <p>My color palette was iterated off of a primary color palette, but lighter (and therefore, more youthful than primary): red became coral, blue became aqua, and yellow became gold.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/Color%20Palettes.png">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>IMPACT</h5>
      <h3>The conclusion</h3>
      <p>The physical exhibition ended up being put on pause when the pandemic forced everyone home in March 2020. However, the exhibition was already organized and this poster already completed, so it was decided to host the exhibition online. I adapted the poster accordingly, to include information on how to find the digital exhibition as well as add a simple looping animation. The animation allowed the museum to have an eye-catching moving graphic that otherwise would not have been useful in a print-only use.</p>

    <h5>BRANDING</h5>
    <h2>Middle East Voices</h2>
    <p class="summary">My experience redesigning the bilingual brand identity of a non-profit organization that focuses on uplifting voices of Middle East refugees in Syracuse.</p>
    <p class="details"><span>Role</span> Branding Design, Motion Design  <span>Timeline</span> 4 weeks </p>

    <div class="process">
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/%5B3%5D%20Web%20Images%20-%20Size%203%20(2).gif">
      <h5>PROBLEM OVERVIEW</h5>
      <h3>Conflict</h3>
      <p>The organization has recently been focusing on expanding their outreach, which required a clear statement of what they do. They needed a fresh, simple logo design that would be straightforward to both English-speakers and Arabic-speakers alike. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>IDEATION</h5>
      <h3>Sketching chapter</h3>
      <p>I approached this project with the organization’s mission of connection, empowerment, and uplifting others in mind. At first, I was interested in creating a logo that incorporated people or human faces, since this was the very core of what Middle East Voices is about. I was also interested in the dynamic, handlettered logo options, but it didn’t fit the requirement of being straightforward and easy to understand. The client ended up responding most positively to the simple, abstract shape logo designs, so I decided to head in this direction.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/Process%20videos%20(4).gif">
      <p>  </p>
      <p>At this point, the idea of having a bilingual logo came up in conversation. The client liked the idea of having one logo but two versions of it to accommodate those within the organization that don’t speak English. Since Arabic is read from right to left (opposite of English) I decided to flip the entire logo to be read and understood from right to left in this version.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/Process%20videos%20(5).gif">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>DESIGN ELEMENTS</h5>
      <h3>The characters</h3>
      <p>Typography — I knew that the typography would need to be clear and easy-to-read in both languages. I limited my selection to those available on Google Fonts, which would make it easier for the web designer later on down the line. To select the Arabic typeface, it required corresponding with the client, who chose the Arabic type out of a lineup for the best readability.</p>
      <p>Abstract shapes — The final logo was chosen for its simplicity and straightforward message of building up the refugee community one step at a time.</p>
      <p>Colors — A simple black logo is the primary logo, for the best contrast levels. I also created a warm gradient logo to give a lively and eyecatching alternative option.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannykirk/shannykirk.github.io/main/images/Color%20Palettes%20(1).png">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h5>IMPACT</h5>
      <h3>The epilogue</h3>
      <p>This branding project was different than many of the other branding projects I’ve worked on in the past few years. The tangible, local effect of the organization was one factor in this. Also, designing for a bilingual audience was a curious and welcomed new challenge to my branding experience.</p>

      <h5>THE INTERVIEW</h5>
      <h3>Read the interview with Christianne Risman</h3>
      <p>To get started, just tell the readers of Go Magazine about yourself. When and how did you started traveling? When did you first get the itch to travel?</p>
      <p>My name is Christianne, I’m a full-time travel vlogger. I’m 26 years old and I have been backpacking on and off since I was 18 years old. It started with a group expedition called World Challenge where we travelled to Tanzania, did some volunteering and climbed Kilimanjaro (so started small, ha!) At the time, Instagram and social media were not such a big thing so all my travel inspiration came from TV documentaries and travel magazines. Watching and consuming anything travel related just made me so excited and want to hop on a plane that very second.</p>
      <p>I couldn’t wait to explore the world.</p>

      <p>What advice do you have for students and people with not much money but dreams of traveling one day, and how do you stay on budget?</p> 
      <p>Know that it’s okay to start small and that some countries are much more affordable than you think. Do your research, plan a trip, have a budget and work towards that goal. It may take some sacrifices, but know that it will be worth it in the end.</p>

      <p>How did you get past the usual excuses—not enough time or money—for not traveling?</p>
      <p>For me, there were never any excuses. Travelling was all I cared about and I would do whatever it took to get what I needed for my trips. I literally centered my life around acquiring temp work until I had enough money to head on a trip. Then I would travel, come back home, and repeat.</p>

      <p>When and where was your first trip? How did you save up and plan?</p>
      <p>After Tanzania in 2012, my first big unsupervised trip was in 2013. A whopping 7 month round-the-world which I would start with 2 friends and we’d travel together on and off through Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Singapore, New Zealand, Fiji and the USA. We’d all been saving up pretty much our whole way through Sixth Form and in the first 6 months of our gap year. We planned it quite literally just by doing our own research, collecting recommendations and working things into a logistical order.</p>

      <p>How do you control spending and budgeting once you’re on the trip?</p>
      <p>I set a budget for myself before going on a trip. I do my research and make sure it’s realistic. And then when I’m on the road, I track my spending. I write down every single thing that I purchase, add it all up, and make sure I’m on track with my original budget. It’s okay to go over or under some days, it’s all about balance!</p>

      <p>Can you recommend websites to find cheap flights and accommodation for people just getting started?</p>
      <p>I always start by opening up an incognito window on the internet. Then I will check Skyscanner and Momondo. I always do a flexible search (as opposed to searching for specific flying dates) as you often find cheaper deals when being flexible.</p>

      <p>Can you give any tips that you have for staying safe as a solo female traveler?</p>
      <p>I think there is this misconception that staying safe as a solo female traveller requires some sort of superpower but ultimately it really just comes down to trusting your instincts and being sensible. IE - avoid going off the beaten track alone and/or at night. Dress appropriately for the location you’re in. Keep your valuables concealed at all times. etc...</p>

      <p>What would you recommend as a first backpacking trip, for budget and experiences?</p>
      <p>The typical beginner backpacker trail in South East Asia is the Thailand-Laos-Vietnam-Cambodia loop. It is great because of how popular it is with backpackers so meeting fellow travellers is guaranteed. There are so many amazing things to do and see AND they are some of the most affordable countries in the world, so you can spend an extended amount of time there, without breaking the bank.</p>

      <p>What is your favorite travel story/experience?</p>
      <p>Getting my Open Water PADI qualification in Utila, Honduras was a really special time for me. It was my first experience of scuba diving and introduced me to the whole underwater world that I’d never seen before. I’ve now gone on to become a Rescue Diver and love everything about scuba diving culture.</p>

      <p>What are some of the biggest illusions people have about travel, backpacking, and making it a lifestyle?</p>
      <p>People think we are on holiday 24/7. And although it is wonderful, it requires a lot more hard work, determination and sacrifice - that people don’t see on social media. It’s not a lifestyle that suits everyone. We are not ‘lucky’ and haven’t just fallen into it. It’s a lifestyle that we have chosen and worked towards and continue working towards to keep it going.</p>

      <p>Any last advice?</p>
      <p>I believe anyone is capable of having a travel lifestyle. But it requires commitment, sacrifice and a bit of creativity. You have to want it enough to make it happen.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>Driftless Photo Story</h3>
      <p>This story was about a group of "bikepackers" (backpackers, but on bikes) cycling over 200 miles in southeast Minnesota's Driftless Area.</p>
      <p>The aim was to have a design that showcased the trip through the stunning visuals.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>THC Experiment</h3>
      <p>This story involved a reporter trying four different THC products for the first time, and documenting her experience.</p>
      <p>Since the print paper could only have the cover page (left) in color, I designed a black and white version for the jump page (right) that could potentially be used as a coloring page.</p>

      <h5>SELECTED PROJECTS</h5>
      <h3>North Dakota vs. South Dakota: Comedic Argumentative Story</h3>
      <p>This story involved two reporters: one from North Dakota, the other from South Dakota. And both felt very passionate about what their state had to offer that the other didn't.</p>
      <p>From the start, my art director and I knew that the illustration would need to reflect the comedic nature of the story, and visually show the clash between the two Dakotas. This illustration and page design was the result.</p>

      <h3>Summer Things to Do in Minneapolis</h3>
      <p>This story is a recurring story that appears in some shape or form every summer in the Star Tribune newspaper. This year, it broke down the best, and most unexpected, things to do with the second-half of the summer. After all, Minnesotans have to enjoy the warm weather while it lasts.</p>
      <p>This was my first cover illustration project during my internship, and I decided to do a vertical format to accommodate all the various activities I would collage together. The jump page (right) ended up having space to add photos from a handful of the activities.</p>
